              Food brings people of all cultures together. This is especially
              true in the Cape Malay community, where sharing a meal is more
              than just eating—it’s about heritage, connection, and tradition.
              From the aroma of freshly baked koesisters on a Sunday morning to
              the warmth of a hearty akhni shared with family, Halaal food is at
              the heart of Cape Town’s vibrant culture.
